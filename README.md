# FullCircle — Food Donation Management System

A web-based platform connecting **food donors** with **NGOs** to reduce food waste and fight hunger.
Food wastage and food insecurity exist together, especially in urban areas. Large amounts of surplus food from restaurants, events, and households are thrown away daily, while many people still do not have access to proper meals. One major reason for this problem is the lack of an organized system to connect food donors with NGOs in real time.

## How the Workflow Works

```
Donor registers → Adds food donation (status: available)
                         ↓
NGO registers → Browses donations → Clicks "Request"
                         ↓
         Request created (status: pending)
                         ↓
Donor sees request in My Donations → Approve / Reject
                         ↓
         If approved → status: approved
         NGO sees donor phone number for pickup coordination
                         ↓
Donor marks as Complete → donation status: completed
```
